        <p>
          I’m <strong>Mochammad Syahrul Kurniawan</strong> from Singaraja, Bali.
          I’m a student at <strong>Universitas Pendidikan Ganesha</strong>. I’m
          currently in my 7th semester and want to focus on a concentration in
          <strong>cyber security</strong> education. I have had several
          experiences in the field of cyber security such as participating in
          the Capture The Flag (CTF) competition and penetrating websites. I
          usually do this with tools on Kali Linux such as Nmap, Nuclei, Dalfox,
          etc. And I'm very excited to be able to continue studying cyber
          security. I am also interested in <strong>web development</strong>,
          especially on the <strong>backend developer</strong> side. Currently I
          am studying the <strong>NodeJS</strong> programming language.
