      <p>
        I’m <strong>Mochammad Syahrul Kurniawan</strong> from Singaraja, Bali.
        I’m a student at <strong>Universitas Pendidikan Ganesha</strong>. I’m
        currently in my 7th semester and want to focus on a concentration in
        <strong>cyber security</strong> education. I have had several
        experiences in the field of cyber security such as participating in the
        Capture The Flag (CTF) competition and penetrating websites. I usually
        do this with tools on Kali Linux such as Nmap, Nuclei, Dalfox, etc. And
        I'm very excited to be able to continue studying cyber security. I am
        also interested in <strong>web development</strong>, especially on the
        <strong>backend developer</strong> side. Currently I am studying the
        <strong>NodeJS</strong> programming language.
